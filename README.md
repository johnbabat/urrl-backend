## About
Urrl is a web app that allows users create short urls and documents as well as analytics on their visits.

A new user can create a short url and visit the url which would automatically redirect to the initial long url.

Users need to be registered in order to create their custom url alias for peronal use.

Users need to be registered to create documents and can decide if to make documents private or public. Private documnents can only be accessed by users who the document has been explicitly shared with.

Urrl also provides visuals and data on short url visits as well as document views.
